# To Do

- [X] Camera and Radar Fusion
    - [X] Yolo to detect the objects
    - [X] Radar Points Mapping with respect to Radar and then implement 

- [ ] Tracking Vehicles
    - [ ] Implementing Kalman Filter to keep track of the objects


- [ ] Checking the latency
    - [ ] Implement the whole scenario to the SNI Server running on GPU and then measure the latency
